MarioMovement.cs: This script handles Marioâ€™s movement and jumping. We use Rigidbody2D for 2D physics and Rigidbody for 3D physics.

Dimension Switching: We switch dimensions by pressing the Space key. Each dimension has its own movement and physics behavior.

2D: Mario moves left and right, jumps with a 2D physics engine.

3D: Mario moves in 3D space with WASD controls and jumps using 3D physics.

Top-Down: A potential for top-down perspective with limited movement on the X and Z axes.
